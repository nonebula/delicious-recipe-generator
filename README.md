# open-weather-map

The Open Weather App has been designed to make sure that as a traveler you are able to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that you can plan a trip accordingly.

## Description 
The goal of this project was to develop a weather program for today and the following five days that would support travellers to plan their days around upcoming weather forecasts with use of the openweathermap API. The program was built with jQuery syntax alongside days.js and vanilla Javascript where necessary. It also utilizes Bootstrap formatting. I have also designed the site using html and css formatting for this project.

## Credits

The project was completed independently but built off the source code from: edX Boot Camps LLC. I worked with a tutor, Armando Osorio, to explore the fundamentals of Javascript and clarify my work. I also worked through the modules on Codecademy to better develop my understanding to enable me to solve this challenge. In producing this webpage, I also utilized a range of tutorials from W3 Schools and referred to multiple posts on Stack Overflow. I also utilized the support of the course teaching assistants and referred to the openweathermap API documentation [https://openweathermap.org/api] and guide [https://openweathermap.org/guide].
